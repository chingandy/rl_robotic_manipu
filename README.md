## How to install the enviroment
1. First of all, you need a MuJoCo license to use MuJoCo.
2. Follow the instruction here:<https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py#install-mujoco>(Install MuJoCo).
3. Install MuJoCo:
  `pip3 install -U 'mujoco-py==2.0.2.0a1'â€‹`
4. Trouble shooting: you may have to add some path to your environment variables.

   ex:
   ```
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib/nvidia-396
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/chingan/.mujoco/mujoco200/bin`
   ```
   If encounter Python locale error:
   ```
   export LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"
   export LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
   sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
   ```
5. Install gym:
   * Change the mujoco_py version in setup.py to 2.0.2.0a1
   * Install gym from source:
     `pip3 install -e '.[mujoco]'`
## How to export the videos recording the training process?
First, import the module `wrappers`
```
from gym import wrappers
from time import time
```
Then, after create the environment, include the line as the following:
```
env = gym.make(ENV_NAME)
env = wrappers.Monitor(env, './videos/' + str(time()) + '/')
```
The mp4 files will save to `./videos`.

We can also include the argument `force=True` to replace your existing recording with the current recording.
```
env = wrappers.Monitor(env, './videos/' + str(time()) + '/')
```
problem: this seems to affect the setting of the customized environment.
```

## How to change the max steps per episode?

You can find the variable `max_episode_steps` in the directory `gym/gym/envs/__init__.py`.
